Gif Generator for WLED effects and palette
------

It requieres a web server (local is enough). 
Web Server for Chrome (by chromebeat.com) it's a good extension for chrome that will give you a local webserver in 2 clicks (just select the root folder and start the server)

It uses gif.js in order to create the gif files. For ease of use I've included the two javascript files in the repository, but you can find the original ones here

Inside the pregen folder you could find different sets of GIFs pregenerated.
